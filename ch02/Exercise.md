**Exercise 1:** Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:  

	5
	x = 5
	x + 1

**Exercise 2:** Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them.  
Enter your name: Chuck

	Ans : ex2.py

**Exercise 3:** Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour to compute gross pay.  
Enter Hours: 35  
Enter Rate: 2.75  
Pay: 96.25  
We wonâ€™t worry about making sure our pay has exactly two digits after the decimal place for now. If you want, you can play with the built-in Python round function to properly round the resulting pay to two decimal places.

	Ans : ex3.py

**Exercise 4:** Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:  
width = 17  
height = 12.0  
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).    
1. width/2  
2. width/2.0  
3. height/3  
4. 1 + 2 * 5  
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.  

	1. float
	2. float
	3. float
	4. int

**Exercise 5:** Write a program which prompts the user for a Celsius temperature, convert the temperature to Fahrenheit, and print out the
converted temperature.
