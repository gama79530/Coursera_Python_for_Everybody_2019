**Exercise 1:** What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?  
a) Execute all of the computation and logic of the program  
b) Retrieve web pages over the Internet  
c) Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle  
d) Take input from the user  

	C

**Exercise 2:** What is a program?  
	
	A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.

**Exercise 3:** What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?  

	Compiler is used in compiled language. It is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).
	Interpreter is used interpreted language. It executes program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code).  

**Exercise 4:** Which of the following contains “machine code”?  
a) The Python interpreter  
b) The keyboard  
c) Python source file  
d) A word processing document  

	A

**Exercise 5:** What is wrong with the following code:  
&gt;&gt;&gt; primt 'Hello world!'  
File "<stdin>", line 1  
primt 'Hello world!'  
^  
SyntaxError: invalid syntax  
&gt;&gt;&gt;  

	Syntax Error.

**Exercise 6:** Where in the computer is a variable such as “x” stored after the following Python line finishes?  
x = 123  
a) Central processing unit  
b) Main Memory  
c) Secondary Memory  
d) Input Devices  
e) Output Devices  

	B


**Exercise 7:** What will the following program print out:  
x = 43  
x = x + 1  
print(x)  
a) 43  
b) 44  
c) x + 1  
d) Error because x = x + 1 is not possible mathematically  

	B

**Exercise 8:** Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3)
Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For ex-
ample, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?  
	
	1. Thinking in mind.  
	2. Memory thing in mind.  
	3. Memorize thing in note.  
	4. Seeing,watching,hearing or touching...  
	5. Performing activity with body.

Exercise 9: How do you fix a “Syntax Error”?  

	1. Find the place with syntax error by tracing traceback message or using IDE with syntax check function. 
	2. Correct it manually.
